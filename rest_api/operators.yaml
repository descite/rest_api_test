    The platform REST API is the foundation of programmatic access to Glia and
    provides a robust set of endpoints that cover all Glia functions - this
    includes the management and configuration of sites, operators, queues,
    channels, etc. as well as controlling engagements, getting statistics and
    many more. It allows for clients to integrate Glia with their existing
    systems, other tools and automate a lot of tasks.
